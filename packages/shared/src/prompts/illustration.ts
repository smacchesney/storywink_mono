Remove all photographic elements - realistic lighting, camera effects, textures should be replaced with illustrated equivalents.${styleDescription ? ` Emphasize these style characteristics: ${styleDescription}` : ''}`,

Simplify and abstract background details into clean illustrated elements (e.g., dirt becomes simple ground texture, cluttered areas become simplified shapes) while keeping key recognizable features that establish the setting.`,
