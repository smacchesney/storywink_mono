Replace all photographic elements (realistic textures, camera lighting, photo grain) with illustrated equivalents.

Translate these elements into illustration form - a wooden fence becomes illustrated wood with simple line work, not photographic grain; metal becomes clean illustrated surfaces with simple highlights, not realistic reflections. Simplify complex backgrounds into essential illustrated elements while keeping the scene recognizable.`,
